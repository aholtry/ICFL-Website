                                    multiple reasons. But one idea is clear while in pursuit of our individual goals, one common theme
                                    resonates: We love the game of American Football. It is the glue holding us all together. In that goal,
                                    we create a brotherhood. To develop an 11-man football league based in the Treasure Valley that is
                                    competitive, family-oriented, and has a clear and positive image in the community.

                                                comfortable to compete and attend ICFL events. Let us all love our ICFL football family.
